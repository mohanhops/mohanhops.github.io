### Why Linux?
There are many reasons for Linux to be extreamly popular, will try to list key factors here:
1. Linux has less security flaws
   * As Linux is Open Source code, huge number of developers will review the code constantly
   * Linux has password authentication, file system discretionary access control, and security auditing, these 3 fundamental security features are essential

2. Linux is Free OS
   * Linux has no licence cost to use it unlike other OS like Windows it is free

3. Performance
   * Linux doesn't have bloat UI features which makes it light weightLinux can run on almost any architecture (`x86`, `ARM`, `RISC-V` .. etc)
   * Linux has organized file system hence it is easy to perform file operatins quickly  

4. Task Austomation
   * Becasue of default shell (`bash`, `zsh`, `sh` .. etc) support in Linux, users can automate most of the regular stuff efficiently on Linux

### How to Install Linux
There are many varients of Linux is available for public. why?
   * Why there are so many cars? Because there are several vehicle manufacturers using the ‘Linux engine’ and each of them has many cars of different types and for different purposes. Since the ‘Linux engine’ is free to use and modify, anyone can use it to build a vehicle on top of it.
