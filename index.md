The aim of this blog it to help people who has no prior or intermediate experience in HPC and Cloud.

This Blog explains best practices in HPC and Cloud, When I started my journey in HPC field I wasn't aware of many things and could not find much help on HPC.

HPC was very old field, and it is currently emerging with Cloud technologies hence I wish to share my experiences and knowledge through this blog.
